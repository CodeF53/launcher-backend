## I found a bug in the launcher, or I have an idea for an enhancement to the launcher! Where do I submit it?

Please use [the launcher issue tracker](https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/launcher/issues/new/choose).

## Installer1 or Installer2?
Installer1 extracts into the main Goose folder.
Installer2 extracts into a folder for your mod.
If your mod ZIP contains a folder already, use Installer1.
If your mod ZIP contains the DLLs and other files directly, use Installer2.
